<h6><a id="sv"></a>ABOUT SLOW VENTURES</h6>

Slow Ventures is a $500M early stage investment fund based in San Fransisco and Boston.  Over the last decade we have backed iconic companies from the earliest days including Venmo, Robinhood, Postmates, Allbirds, Casper, Next-door, Slack, Airtable, Ro, and many more.  

We usually invest when companies are no more than a founder and idea & our core mission is to be deeply aligned with our founders through the ups & downs (and frequently arduous process) of building great companies.

Probably most importantly - As long-time seed investors, the reality is that we are very used to backing people more than anything else… which is why the Influencer Fund - which directly backs people vs. companies - is a natural evolution for us. 

Within Slow, the Influencer Fund is managed by Sam Lessin.  Sam was VP of Product at Facebook from 2010-2014.  He has founded two companies - drop.io (sold to Facebook), and [Fin Analytics](https://www.fin.com).  He has been working in and around new ways to help individuals get access to financing beyond debt for a long time, making several investments in the ISA space (), and Hosting the [Life Capital Conference](http://www.lifecapital.com/)) on alternative financing models for people, and even some [ancient IP](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20020133445A1/en?oq=samuel+lessin+marketplace) on the topic. 

<h6><a id="if"></a>ABOUT THE INNFLUENNCER FUND</h6>

The Slow Ventures Influencer Fund is designed specifically to invest capital in individuals to help them build their brands & create more value.  We invest anywhere from **$100K to $5M** in each person in return for anywhere from **1-5%** of the influencer / creator’s future earnings over their careers.    There are a few important things to understand about how our fund works: 

<b> No commitment investment </b> — We do not tell people how to spend the money we invest - nor do we force creators and influencers to take any specific action.  This is how we have always done venture investing - trusting great people to know their business and how to invest our money, the same goes for these creators.

<b> Teamwork Focus </b> — We always welcome collaboration with other investors when making our investment.  In venture investing, we have always found the collaborative approach best. ‘It takes a village’…. In our ideal model, we invest in a creator or influencer alongside other strategic investors (for instance, if you are a fitness influencer, we help bring on other big-name successful fitness influencers to invest in you and help you grow).  

<b> Long-Term Focus </b> Because of how the influencer fund works, our goal is that our long-term interests are 100% aligned with your long-term interests.  Most models for financing talent are short-term and therefore pressure the talent to make as much money as possible quickly.  Some other models are focused on giving talent ‘up front’ money in return for forcing them to produce certain work or results for their ‘investors’.  That isn’t how our fund works, because we get paid when you get paid.

<b> Minimize Risk for Talent </b> What if you take a few years off?  What if something goes wrong and you don’t end up making money?  The Slow Ventures Influencer’s fund only gets a return on your earning above and beyond a threshold.   <b> We only want to do well if you are doing very well. </b> Our fund protects those we invest in by only participating in profits over a certain amount per year.  


<h6><a id="if"></a>HOW IT WORKS</h6>

At a high level, the approach looks like this:

	1. We work with a creator / influencer to set a fair price for an investment in their creative career.
	2. We help the creator establish a business that represents their creative career & assign that company the correct income streams, IP, and equity (much like how people setup trusts)
	3. We invest in the company for a small minority share.  If the creator wants we can ‘lead’ the investment and include other value-added investors (just like we do for seed-stage companies)
	4. The creator retains complete freedom and control in their careers.  There is no deliverable, etc.  Just as we help early-stage companies we look to do the same for early-stage creatives.
