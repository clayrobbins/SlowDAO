1) Organizations - C-Corps, LLCs, Collectives, Co-Ops, investment funds, etc., are over 100 years old and don’t fit the future needs of the way individuals and tech meet to organize and produce.

2) Over the last 30 years, digitization has upgraded information through the internet, money through crypto and now the corporation is in the process of being upgraded and instantiated in the form of DAOs.

3) As investment vehicles, DAOs enable more efficient formation and deployment of capital, which introduces novel properties in the form of accessibility, liquidity, speed, and governance.

4) By pioneering the first compliant structure to invest in “off-chain” assets and bring them “on-chain” via a DAO, Slow DAO 1 will cross the chasm between the physical and digital worlds.

Slow DAO 1 will identify parcels of land within Teton County that show promise of prospective future value due to a myriad of factors including location, commercial or residential viability, and accessibility to infrastructure. We’ll commit an average of $500,000 to purchase parcels through the DAO, which is a registered Wyoming LLC.

The DAO will be managed following several core operating principles:

1 - <b>Compliance first.</b> We’ve spent an inordinate amount of time, effort, and money to determine the ideal structure for executing on this vision in accordance with US law. Timing is in our favor as Wyoming has recently passed legislation that recognizes DAOs as legal entities in the state, which enables us to operate freely as any investment fund would with the same legal protections afforded to traditional LLCs.

2 - <b>Land only.</b> The function of Slow DAO 1 is to find and purchase land in Teton County, Wyoming that not only acts as the asset that proves our thesis, but also has future value.

3 - <b>Liquidity as a feature</b> Investor interest in the Slow DAO 1 will be liquid after 1 year, but then are available for liquidation or transfer through qualified channels. This represents the first time equity in off-chain assets will be available for transfer and sale on crypto-native rails.

4 - <b>Starting Small</b> Membership in Slow DAO 1 is open only to US Qualified Purchasers, and no more than 500 people/entities will ever be members (there will be a maximum of 500 units available to investors and a cap on individual ownership of XX%).

<b>Operations and governance will be managed by the DAO.<b> Though off-chain business operations will be conducted by the DAO manager (Slow), approval of both purchase and liquidation of acquired parcels will be managed by the DAO.

<b>Slow’s interest is making money for investors on reasonable<b> terms. By enforcing a traditional fund structure we intend to align the interest of DAO members with Slow.

<b>If you don’t like us? Give us the boot.<b> We’ve baked a feature that enables replacement of the DAO manager with a XX% of memberships vote.
