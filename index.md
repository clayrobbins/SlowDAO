<h4 style="font-size: 22px">THE SLOW VENTURES CREATOR FUND</h4> 

Supporting modern creators with professional seed capital to grow their communities and fulfill their potential.

*The most valuable brands of the future are going to be people rather than companies.  However, in order to get to a future a few key things need to change about how creator brands are built, financed and valued. [more on our thesis](http://creator.slow.co/thesis)*

[Slow Ventures](http://www.slow.co) is a $500M early stage investment fund based in San Fransisco and Boston.  Over the last decade we have backed iconic companies from the earliest days including <b>Venmo, Robinhood, Postmates, Allbirds, Casper, Slack, Airtable, Ro</b>, and [many more](http://main.slow.co/about/).  

We usually invest when companies are no more than a founder and idea & our core mission is to be deeply aligned with our founders through the ups & downs (and frequently arduous process) of building great companies.

Probably most importantly - As long-time seed investors, the reality is that we are very used to backing people more than anything else… which is why the Creator Fund - which directly backs people vs. companies - is a natural evolution for us. 

Within Slow, the Creator Fund is managed by [Sam Lessin](https://www.twitter.com/lessin).  Sam was VP of Product at Facebook from 2010-2014.  He has founded two companies - drop.io (sold to Facebook), and [Fin Analytics](https://www.fin.com).  He has been working in and around new ways to help individuals get access to financing beyond debt for a long time, making several investments in the ISA space (Stride, Vemo, Pando Pooling), and Hosting the [Life Capital Conference](http://www.lifecapital.com/)) on alternative financing models for people, and even some [ancient IP](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20020133445A1/en?oq=samuel+lessin+marketplace) on the topic.

The Slow Ventures Creator Fund is designed specifically to invest capital in individuals to help them build their brands & create more value.  We can invest anywhere from **$100K to $5M** in each person in return for anywhere from **1-5%** of the creator’s future earnings over their careers.  We also can lead syndicates and bring on other co-investors (just as we do with traditional companies).  There are a few important things to understand about how our fund works: 

<b> No requirement investment </b> — We do not tell people how to spend the money we invest - nor do we force creators to take any specific action.  This is how we have always done venture investing - trusting great people to know their business and how to invest our money, the same goes for how we support creators.

<b> Teamwork Focus </b> — We always welcome collaboration with other investors when making our investment.  In venture investing, we have always found the collaborative approach best. ‘It takes a village’…. In our ideal model, we invest in a creator alongside other strategic investors (for instance, if you are a fitness creator, we help bring on other big-name successful fitness creators to invest in you and help you grow).  

<b> Long-Term Focus </b> Because of how the creator fund works, our goal is that our long-term interests are 100% aligned with your long-term interests.  Most models for financing talent are short-term and therefore pressure the talent to make as much money as possible quickly.  Some other models are focused on giving talent ‘up front’ money in return for forcing them to produce certain work or results for their ‘investors’.  That isn’t how our fund works, because we get paid when you get paid.

<b> Minimize Risk for Talent </b> What if you take a few years off?  What if something goes wrong and you don’t end up making money?  The Slow Ventures Creator’s fund only gets a return on your earning above and beyond a threshold.   <b> We only want to do well if you are doing very very well. </b>, We always want to do well of course, but we are making early investments in people willing to take big risks on their careers - and we understand that sometimes it doesn't work out.  If that is the case and we lose our investment, that is OK.

<b>>Step 1:</b> We work with a creator to understand their capital needs & set a fair valuation on their creative career.  This is a collaborative process and works pretty much exactly the same way as when we invest in seed stage companies.

<b>>Step 2:</b> We help the creator establish a business that represents their creative career & assign that company the correct income streams, IP, and equity (much like how people setup trusts)

<b>>Step 3:</b> We invest in the company for a small minority share.  If the creator wants we can ‘lead’ the investment and include other value-added investors (just like we do for seed-stage companies)

<b>>Step 4:</b> The creator retains complete freedom and control in their careers.  There is no deliverable, etc.  Just as we help early-stage companies we look to do the same for early-stage creatives.  As investors we get paid a percentage of annual creative revenue if the creator is succeeding and making significant money from their career.
