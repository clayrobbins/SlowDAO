1) The corporation is over 100 years old and are not fit to serve the way individuals and tech organize and operate.

2) Digitization has upgraded information through the internet, money through crypto, and now corporations through DAOs.

3) As investment vehicles, DAOs enable more efficient formation and deployment of capital, which introduces novel properties in the form of accessibility, liquidity, speed, and governance.

4) By pioneering a compliant structure to invest in “off-chain” assets and bring them “on-chain” via a DAO, Slow DAO 1 will cross the chasm between the physical and digital worlds.

Slow DAO 1 will identify parcels of land within Teton County that show promise of prospective future value based on a myriad of factors including location, commercial or residential viability, and accessibility to infrastructure. We’ll commit an average of $500,000 to purchase parcels through the DAO, which is a registered Wyoming LLC.

The DAO will be managed following several core operating principles:

1 - <b>Compliance first.</b> We’ve spent an inordinate amount of time, effort, and money to determine the ideal structure for executing on this vision in accordance with US law. Timing is in our favor as Wyoming has recently passed legislation that recognizes DAOs as legal entities in the state, which enables us to operate freely as any investment fund would with the same legal protections afforded to traditional LLCs.

2 - <b>Land only.</b> The function of Slow DAO 1 is to find and purchase land in Teton County, Wyoming which will act as the MVP asset to prove our thesis due to relative simplicity of acquisition.

3 - <b>Liquidity as a feature</b> Investor interests in the Slow DAO 1 will be locked for 1 year but subsequently become free to exchange though qualified channels.

4 - <b>Starting Small</b> Membership in Slow DAO 1 is open only to US Qualified Purchasers, and no more than XXX individuals/entities will ever be members (there will be a maximum of XXX units available to investors and a cap on individual ownership of XX%).

<b>Operations and governance will be managed by the DAO.</b> Though off-chain business operations will be conducted by the DAO manager (Slow), approval of both purchase and liquidation of acquired parcels will be managed DAO members.

<b>Slow’s interest is making money for investors on reasonable terms.</b> By enforcing a traditional fund structure we intend to align the interest of DAO members with Slow.

<b>If you don’t like us? Give us the boot.</b> We’ve baked a governance feature that enables replacement of the DAO manager with a XX% of memberships vote.
