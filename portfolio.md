VIDA puts out design inspirations that emerging, global designers submit their unique designs to. The VIDA customers have a limited time to pre-order their favorite designs, which VIDA manufactures on-demand and delivers within 7-17 days of order. The premise is that by tapping into a growing community of  creatives, we offer unique, inspiring products, against the more commonly found homogenous store-bought looks. And by removing wholesale markups,  supply-demand inefficiencies, and the need to carry and manage inventory, we offer highly competitive price-points to our customers and attractive terms to our designers, while managing healthy margins for the business. Moreover, for our manufacturers, we ensure livable wages and a meaningful opportunity to build a better future - for every $1 earned, VIDA invests another $1 in the future of the communities we source from - enabling our customers to participate in responsible commerce without paying a premium for it.<br><br>
