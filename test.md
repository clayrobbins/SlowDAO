At the end of each year I try to find time to reflect on the year gone-by, and consider what I learned that can inform how I live and work in the upcoming year.  

This year - more than most - there is an enormous amount to reflect on, and I wanted to share my thinking for those that might be interested (sorry if I over-sampled and you are not / just trash it & if you really don’t want to hear from me again LMK here!).  For those that are curious, I am going to break down this note into four areas.  

(1) Lessons as an Investor: Stay the Course Through The Chaos <br>
(2) Lessons from Operating Fin Analytics:  Surf the Wave <br>
(3) Big Picture Social & Economic Thinking:  History Rhymes  <br>
(4) Personal life & media favorites on the year…

## Investing Lessons:  Stay the Course
At the beginning of COVID - like most other people - I expected that there would be a big pull-back in investment activity and pricing across the boards.  I *briefly* bought the narrative that there would be a race to cash and away from equities & that the venture world would grind to a halt as people ‘battened down the hatches’. 

What actually happened was that after a brief pause in venture & a quick pullback on tech stocks - the world of tech investing & valuations rocketed forward.  Things could have gone differently, and I think the government did a good job overall infusing cash (and confidence) into the economy.  

But the big story was really about the physical world and the virtual world going into full divergence …  ([The Escalating War Between Our Physical and Digital Realities  — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-escalating-war-between-our-physical-and-digital-realities)) and if anything instead of there being the expected ‘flight to dollars’ for security, it felt like a flight to tech, and people effectively selling out of the ‘present’ and buying into ‘hope of the future’

BIG PICTURE:  There are four lessons I take from my initial miscalculation on where things were going and then dramatic acceleration in the tech world:

> (1) Chaos can in theory disrupt history, but in the case of COVID and perhaps most high-velocity moments, it mostly just serves to accelerate what is already happening — COVID just pulled us a few years forward on all the trends that were already there   

> (2) When the present is messed up, the safety raft might be hope for the future…. In theory, in times of chaos dollars / cash is supposed to be the safe place to store money to transport to the future / a better time… but in this case - against the backdrop of lots of money printing - it seems like the place everyone turned to store money / value for the future was / is tech.  

> (3) ‘Inflation’ isn’t something you should think about as uniform.  When I think of inflation, I still think about the cost of bred and eggs - but that isn’t really what happens…. Inflation can be in specific categories like Jackson Hole Real estate & tech equities … it is all just based on where the dollars pool up.  

> (4) You are probably early.  The repeated biggest investing mistakes I have made consistently in my life is seeing something / a trend or an opportunity but thinking to myself that I am too ‘late’ or the impact is already priced in.  I made this mistake so many times during the pandemic with public companies I wanted to buy into like Zoom, Peloton, Blue Apron.  I forced myself not to make this mistake with Cloudflare…. Which I didn’t buy as early as I wanted, but still ultimately pulled the trigger on.    

EARLY STAGE VENTURE:  I had the opportunity to witness many early stage founders engage with the moment of crisis in existing portfolio companies, and even a handful of new investments throughout the pandemic.  Here are some of the lessons I learned from watching and interacting with them throughout this crazy period.

> (5) Hardship / chaotic moments show true colors — you really don’t know people til you see them under stress and tension… Having a se one of which founders will use chaos as a ladder vs. wither under pressure, or default to blind hope - is a key thing to consider in any company, because at some point there will be a test (hopefully not as dramatic as some faced this year!)  

> (6) Winners do keep winning - momentum smashing through walls is a thing…. And it is interesting that even through massive moments of change, those with clear winning hands broadly speaking kept winning  

> (7) Don’t get overly greedy, don’t try to catch falling knives without a plan, and don’t ‘chase’ things unnaturally - most, though not all of the opportunities I looked at to ‘play’ the pandemic in the private markets I think turned out to be not good ideas.  I think that this is somewhat different than the public markets where there were / are ample ways to play point events as a ‘trader’ — but as an investor you should be very careful of playing local events.  

> (8) If you invest early, be very clear where the company’s next money comes from— this is the will-quist-ism I very much have come to adopt.  As early stage investors the most important thing is making sure the company gets through to the next round, which means making sure the things they re working on / the milestones align with what later-stage investors will fund.    

> (9) Price isn’t Important so long as it is RATIONAL & signals well — a few things I did this year we over-negotiated on price… look, price matters for returns and setting companies up well for future financings BUT I pretty much regret not doing the things where the market was just pricing them higher than I though they should be — but the markets real people making real bids…. I should have been more flexible BUT two caveats (a) founders asking for irrational prices is a good signal they are not good / are to be avoided … the price discovery bit is more about learning who they are than the actual price in that case (b) make sure the ‘market’ is rational good players and not just anyone…  

> (10) Don’t worry about competition from big companies on new things —you can’t compete with big companies in their own turf — but again this year we see how hard it is for even the best big companies to turn their massive ships around… feel free to compete with them on anything that isn’t directly in their path already.  

> (11) The Future Mostly Works out as Expected - honestly corona virus impact has not been surprising - the future is playing out mostly as expected and is just accelerated — even big impacts might change the meta-narrative less than most people think…. Going a step further - it is interesting to see this year that businesses that were part of the ‘future narrative’ (Postmates) but struggled with the reality of the market today, etc. were ‘saved’ by the COVID lurch into the future.

## Operating Lessons:  Surfing Waves
If as an investor I felt like the story of the year was broadly ‘stay the course’ and ‘the future comes faster than expected, but is still the ‘expected’ future’ …. As an operator building Fin Analytics the lesson this year that sticks with me is about surfing.  

For the last few years working on Fin Analytics we have built towards a thesis that in the future knowledge work would have to be instrumented fully to be optimized.  

From our own experience working on an assistant product, we recognized a big gap between manufacturing optimization (which is highly data-driven) and service and knowledge work, which is shockingly un-instrumented - and therefore very hard to optimize scientifically.  

We built great software and saw early success, but the reality is that COVID was a major turning point for a few reasons:

> (1) Operations and Customer Service teams went home and needed new solutions:  the whole world shifted how customer service and operations were fulfilled in a matter of a few weeks.  This transition was anticipated over years, but doing it without a playbook and so quickly was completely unexpected and created huge demand for what we do at Fin Analytics because teams needed data driven insight into how the shift was going and how to make sure their teams were doing well despite not being able to see them in an office.   

> (2) Operations work had to change enough there was / is a window for innovation:  Customer service and operations teams generally can operate by the principle of ‘if it isn’t broken don’t fix it’ — that is, until there is a major point of disruption.  Once there is a point of disruption, though - it creates far more receptivity to change across the board because the old ‘working’ playbook gets thrown out.  These moments of disruption are key for opening minds.  

> (3) Huge pressures on budgets created demand for things which enhanced efficiency:  Something like operations or customer service isn’t necessarily the first place people look at the c-suite level for optimization because it is usually easier and more glamorous to focus on growing revenue top-line, or easier to make cuts and adjustments elsewhere… however, in times of real pressure everything gets a fresh look for new opportunities.   

> (4) Lots of new hiring and training gaps created new demands for optimization:  Similar to new pressures on efficiency, when you are hiring lots of new people quickly it creates new pressures and demands.  

What does all this amount to?  In a sense it makes operating to me feel like surfing… we paddled out, got in position, and then had to wait for a moment like this last year to happen / for a wave to come in (and no doubt this one was a doozy).

Fin wouldn’t have been able to take advantage of the disruption if we weren’t already in position, ready, and watching the horizon for the right thing… but when everything lined up in the last year we were able to take full advantage of the push of the wave — close our first really big marquee deals, build out the team, and much much more (which we will announce at some point).

Now the exercise for Fin, again - sticking with the surfing thing - is to paddle back out, use everything we learned and the strength and confidence we got from the last year - and do it all over again surfing bigger and bigger ‘waves’….  Getting picker and more exact about our ‘wave selection’ of what we choose to ride vs. let pass, etc.

## Lessons from Writing & Thinking
I love my internship at The Information because it gives me the excuse to think (and write) more broadly than the early stage startup world I am generally professionally involved in.  Looking back at my writing over the year, there were a handful of themes I think I was (rightfully) obsessed with./ consistently wrote about throughout the year:

- Learnings from Covid & Covid Response
- On Culture and Media Broadly
- On Section 230 Specifically & Speech Policy Generally
- On Future of ‘Work’
- On The Future of Money, Finance, and Taxation


### Learnings from Covid & Covid Response
Throughout the year I - like many others - tried both to get involved in the immediate response to covid as well as think through the second and third order effects of the pandemic.

#### What it feels like When It Feels Like The Calvary is Not Coming: Experience Buying and Shipping PPE from China:
I scrambled with some friends to raise (and donate) money, buy & deliver medical supplies from China when that was the immediate crunch.  This was an interesting experience / place to be when it felt like the US federal government / the Calvary really wasn’t coming to help — it was also a strange to be in the middle of a system that was clearly completely un-optimized / a mess and un-coordinated … but still worth doing.  I (and others) had no delusions that we were getting good prices on PPE or allocating them to the exactly right spots, but in that moment done was better than ‘good’ let alone ‘perfect’.  It was eye-opening to be in a place where it felt like things needed to be done, but there was no one to turn to in a trusted way to know how to act / what to do.

#### How Do You Get Important Projects Built From Technologists without Time for ‘Capitalism’ to work Properly — Organizing the COVID Global Hackathon in March:
In March I helped put together a global covid Hackathon, which ultimately 18K people participated in from 175 countries - submitting 1,560 projects.  The idea came from knowing that so many people with so many skills were stuck at home and wanted to get involved / help but had no idea what to do or how to use their skills.  This Hackathon ultimately got big with the support of many great partners in the tech world who got involved — and I think did some good giving a lot of scared passionate people at some something to focus on & a way to connect with other people looking to create solutions to a whole new crop of problems.  That said, I think the big challenge with getting valuable products and ideas out of it vs. creating connection, focus, and thinking — was one an issue of coordination.  Primarily, technologists at home were not going to solve COVID, but there were problems they could solve in communities getting food and supplies to elderly stuck at home, or helping with loneliness — these ideas kept coming up, but without the time and framework for capitalism to run its course (or necessarily the profit incentive) it was hard to get teams with overlapping ideas to productively coordinate.  It is amazing how capitalism and normal market functions don’t work to solve problems when there isn’t enough time….

#### When Politics and Culture Stymie Tech Response:  Apple and Google 
How did contact tracing never really happen in the US?  Privacy culture + lack of political will are the keys — but it is interesting to see how this trickled through society & in particular how the big tech platforms navigated it…. There is no question in my mind that in theory Apple and Google could have quickly moved to deploy contact-tracing-at-scale and prevented a lot of death — early in covid I feared that it would happen — and short term would be great, but long-term break the seal on massive state surveillance and control  — instead Apple (and Google) very cleverly created a framework and APIs that made it in theory ‘possible’ for them to aid with contact tracing efforts BUT in practice would never actually work at scale.  I don’t blame them - this is the politically savvy playbook to run …. But it is an interesting demonstration of how in practice tech as a force is not independent and doesn’t act independently.  

> [How Google and Apple Need to Play the Covid Contact Tracing Debate’s Next Phase — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-google-and-apple-need-to-play-the-covid-contact-tracing-debates-next-phase)

#### How Rapid Changes of Fate and Fortune Impact The Tone of Tech:  Tech Companies & Disillusionment
Pre-covid many delivery services were in trouble… as Covid started Airbnb got hammered…. Right before covid WeWork imploded (which is historically unfortunate, because I would have liked to see them try to navigate it as a public company)…. But as of today basically all of tech is slaying as dollars flee the physical world and we lurch forward in history by several years quickly.  Early on I thought a flipping of winners and losers (Doordash ascendancy as Airbnb gets crushed etc) would create disillusionment in the tech ranks - but obviously things didn’t play out that way.

#### The Impermanence of Romance:  Big Tech’s Time to Sine & Its Limited Window of Relevance
It was interesting watching Amazon and Facebook get to be heroes in the early pandemic keeping people supplied and connected.  Both companies on the brink of anti-trust and with bad brand problems had a moment to once again be appreciated (which feels like has largely passed in our ‘what have you done for me lately’ blindness) —Also it is clear that resentment rises when the world is suffering and your stock prices are skyrocketing through a global pandemic.  Nonetheless, interesting to see and feel big-tech get stronger through this period.

#### Hope is the Investment Asset of Last Resort:  Startups and Venture Ecosystem Through the Crisis
Early in the pandemic I - like many - saw the brief pause in venture activity in early lockdowns and figured this would finally be the moment of pullback.  

#### The relevance of location in general, and cities in particular
When the internet was young there was a hot debate about whether the new technology would bias in favor of urban areas or suburban / rural areas.  For the last 20 years the answer has been pro-city.  Tech made the diversity in cities way more accessible and improved security, they became the general default spot.  COVID as obviously reversed this - and as the cycle goes, suburban and rural is now the answer for many people — now, whether COVID is really just the ‘straw that breaks the camel’s back’ on urban flight or a meaningful long-term different maker is up for debate, but in my mind there is no question that we now are going to see a major multi-decade shift away from dense urban areas — which will bring with it all sorts of tax and political implications.

### On Culture and Media Broadly
COVID accelerated change in media norms with people stuck at home lonely and bored.   Not since cell phones did possible digital media time and engagement expand so much so quickly… Just as the government is revving up anti-trust cases what you really see happening is a revolution of new services, and whole new ways of thinking about the playing field of digital entertainment (and monetization) 

#### The rise of Tiktok & return of pure-entertainment over ‘social media’
For a while I have been interested in what I see as the professionalization of social media.  The idea is that social media - from people / friends - took over from traditional media because your friends were more interesting than the ‘bland’ mass media celebrities of an earlier generation…. But that what you are seeing on Instagram what the re-assertion of ‘professional’ friends / influencers who were more targeted, more beautiful, and more extreme than your real friends — professional friends were just more interesting than real friends.  With the pandemic a huge vacuum opened up where people’s media demand went way way up stuck at home…. And rather than influencers filling it, we saw the rise of things like TikTok — where  the crowd, mediated by a pure algorithm vs. any explicit follow model — delivered constant high-quality entertainment that could out-compete influencers.

> [Why Instagram’s Reels Rollout Will Slow, but Not Stop, TikTok’s Growth — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-instagrams-reels-rollout-will-slow-but-not-stop-tiktoks-growth)


#### The rise of OnlyFans & Funnel-ification of Free Social Media
It is pretty clear that in the future everyone will treat free social media like a top-of-funnel for engagement.  The idea that there will be a single dominant social network is fading (just as regulation, always a decade too late, tries to claim that Facebook is some sort of monopoly) …. Instead everyone will be on every network AND using those networks to funnel engagement down to more ‘intimate’ (and frequently paid) relationships with true fans…. The story of the rise of Only Fans (which brings with it a ton of interesting side-narratives about the normalization of sex-work when people lack connection AND need money, the rise of people generating alternative identities / online characters, pure algorithmic discovery, etc.) is key here..

> [Lessons From the Rise of OnlyFans — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans)

#### The ‘rise’ of Clubhouse & lots of new social experiments 
Right before the pandemic we ran a conference (Our third) on the future of social…. It was the last mass event I went to, and we gave out gloves (at that point the early evidence was that COVID was transmitted by touch!) …. the simple reality is that we just went through the greatest expansion of demand for digital media we have seen since the cell phone because of COVID.  Everyone ran out of Facebook and Instagram, and would download any app / try anything that might lead to new interesting content and connection.  Clubhouse is a great product / there is some deep universal truth in what they are unlocking - which is that voice ‘conversation’ really is the fundamental human unit of communication (vs. monologue, etc.)  BUT it (and other experiences) wouldn’t have happened as they have without the COVID gap.  

> [The Over-Under on New Voice-Chat App Clubhouse — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-over-under-on-new-voice-chat-app-clubhouse)

#### On Section 230 Specifically & Speech Policy Generally
We went in to 2020 expecting a knife-fight around digital speech and the clash of governments and technology platforms.  While we got through the election relatively unscathed, the summer of civil unrest (connected clearly to COVID) and ending the year with multiple anti-trust suits and attacks on section 230 - we basically got what we expected.

I spent a lot of time considering and writing on the topic throughout the year - and basically am where I started:

(a) The solution to 230 is to ‘split the baby’:  Platforms should take more responsibility for things they editorialize / select for people and promote.  This includes paid advertisements & boosted / recommended content.  The old arguments that this is simply impossible and would squelch innovation don’t hold up with modern machine learning and big data.  That said, simultaneously 230 / free speech protections should be hardened and extended for all content that people explicitly ask for / request from creators.  Much like the mail service, content platforms should have way less latitude in defining what they will / will not deliver from creators to consumers upon request.  

> [On Feed Ranking and Free Speech — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/on-feed-ranking-and-free-speech)

(b) What we should really fear the nexus of encryption + ephemerality + deep fakes:  This has been a hobby horse of mine for a long time - the more speech is assaulted and limited, the more speech will find its ways into the technological shadows of whispers….  This in practice means places where media is encrypted & ephemeral - so it is impossible to reconstruct what happened when things go wrong.  These factors, combined with convincing deep fake technology (where we are just getting started) is going to create a mess — it isn’t that whispers didn’t exist before, but before at least the trade was that for mass distribution you needed what you said to be in the ‘light’, where if you wanted lack of accountability and liability for speech you had to operate with a limited and slow shadow network.  With the internet, however, these whispers on messaging networks - which is where all the scary stuff really is — become super liquid and super-empowered.  Upshot - there is a lot to digest in the world of speech with new technology, but we are way way too obsessed with the problems we can see and sort of measure because they are ‘public’ vs. the real deep issues tech bubbles up.

(c) The only path forward is identity + education + people feeling like they have a stake in reality:  As I have written about for years, we are heading towards a world where you can’t evaluate truth anymore from just what you see, you need to trust the person you are hearing it from.  We have to educate people to assume that by default whatever they see is a lie in the ‘unwashed’ anonymous internet - and trust only information from sources they trust and have a long-term meaningful relationship with.  Finally, the reality is that confirmatory fantasy is going to be more compelling and accessible than reality most of the time to most people.  We need people to feel like they have a stake in reality and a stake in the decisions that are being made vs. simply treating reality as separate from them and all content as pure entertainment.  Ultimately, the real problem of fake-news is that people don’t feel like they have a meaningful stake in reality.

### On Future of ‘Work’
The future of work is probably the most obvious place where everyone sees that the pandemic ‘ripped’ us years into the future… 

> [The Long-Term Implications of Extended Work From Home — The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-long-term-implications-of-extended-work-from-home)

#### The true white-collar globalization & its coming reverberations 
There have been intellectual debates about the effectiveness and possibility of remote work for years and years.  Necessity just forced the experiment at scale, and the results are basically that it works — what now comes is going to be a fascinating multi-year game to be played around how global talent sourcing with remote work drives down white-collar wages, stops employee activism (just as 200 folks at google try to unionize), and makes the world more fair and open - but in so doing destroys the huge privilege of talent in the US (not to mention SF and NYC) - with social and political ramifications.

#### Measurement, Measurement, Measurement
I have been beating this drum forever - but the COVID era put a huge premium on better measurement of knowledge work…. mostly because it forced such rapid change in business practices for so many firms, which created a moment where the mantra of ‘if it isn’t broken don’t fix it’ just no longer held.  All of a sudden measurement (from task management software, to things like Fin which instrument work practice) got a huge jolt forward.  This will now only continue.

#### Activism at the ‘workplace’
What a crazy summer this was for activism and debates about activism in the workplace.  It will be curious to see what happens here.  My sense is that employee leverage in tech companies in particular is about to decline a lot — but there is no question that in a place and time where people individually feel powerless stuck at home with issues all around them AND are told by internal marketing they are the key to large powerful tech platforms — the idea will continue to occur to many that the workplace is their point of leverage for the political and social causes they believe in… 

### The Future of Money, Finance, and Taxation
It isn’t that complicated…. We printed a ton of money that didn’t have much place to go except back into equities.  At the same time, with people stuck at home physical locations just got a lot less sticky, which makes regional taxation harder and harder. 

#### Bitcoin
The halving of Bitcoin didn’t have the early impact many thought it would… but the combination of worries about inflation from money printing and dramatically expanding access / on ramps certainly have created a moment this year for BTC’s store of value narrative.  Going forward I don’t see any way this narrative doesn’t accelerate… but the line in crypto from the early days of ‘born in ’08’, crowned in ’20’ feels right to me.

#### SPACs
Where does all the money go!  SPACs for 3 reasons.  First, the appetite for tech investing is enormous as tech has captured an unlikely and historically unusual position on the chess board of being both the ‘safest’ place to put money and the place to find ‘growth’ (usually these things are at odds, but in a world where no one knows how to value physical infra it is reasonable) — as big tech gets bid up, people are looking for the next set of public market opportunities.  Demand is up!  Second, pricing edge.  For years the private markets seemed willing to pay more for tech than the public markets, now the reverse has become true as private investors cling to some sense of ‘reality’ and the public goes the way of Robinhood option trading & Tesla at 600B.  Third, they are so so profitable for everyone… except maybe the private equity holders of companies that are doing SPACs and small SPAC investors.  Think what you will about the rationality of taking smaller tech companies private, as currently structured the banks, hedge funds, SPAC managers, and everyone else makes out like absolute bandits from these structures… so of course you will see more.  

#### Taxes
It is good that broadly speaking the Tax hole that everyone expects at the state level in the early pandemic from decline in income taxes, etc. hasn’t played out as badly as expected so far - but this moment of high costs / expenses for states AND increasing population mobility is going to cause a problem.  The way we handle state taxes has never really made perfect sense in the US but it mostly worked — in a fully liquid world where people work from everywhere and move at will, things are going to get very very hard (as we are already seeing with certain intra-state tax lawsuits, etc.) — will this force a state tax race to the bottom?  A re-evaluation of the system? We will see but this really matters.

#### Inflation
We are going to have inflation… maybe not in the price of bread — but it is just impossible that we will not.  My theory is that we are already clearly seeing it, but since mostly people are saving now if they can, and they aren’t saving cash — we should understand rising stock prices as actual inflation in ‘asset pricing’ more than anything else…

## Personal Life 
On a personal front, I think this year was a -strange- blessing for three reasons (1) it forced me to break out of a routine that I don’t think was making me particularly happy (2) it forced us to experiment with styles of living which I think are better for me / us going forward (3) It cleared a path for big moments of Joy - while hard at times, it was a legitimately fun year / best in a long time.

Here is a selection of some things that in particular come to mind / stick out:

#### I don’t like being in an office 5 days a week & don’t need to ever again…
This is something that without the pandemic I probably would have never tried - but it clearly suits me.  A few days a week going downtown works for me, but I am a big believer that WFH (if your home has enough space to accommodate) is quite ideal for real productive work.

#### Home workouts with a trainer are great
Going to the gym and working out with a trainer is an important routine for me.  I thought I would really miss not seeing my trainer in person — but the reality is that using FB portal with my trainer has worked quite well.  I do miss the very heavy / max-ed out sets you can do in a gym with physical support, so probably will go back to in-person meetings with a trainer from time to time, but I bet I will stay 2/3rds workout over portal with Trainer.

#### We 100% can spend summers remote with family
I grew up with the insane luxury of spending a lot of time with family on cape-cod (my dad would work weeks in the city and commute up, and the kids would camp out up there) — my operating theory was that that era was gone / there was no chance I could do that — now I am completely convinced I can work from there a few months a year (or really anywhere when kids aren’t in school) — which is really exciting / I think will meaningfully change the texture of my life in the next decade or two.

#### I love learning new skills from zero up
Because of how weird the pandemic was, I got to pick up a few new skills from literally zero / never having done before status to intermediate level — this is awesome — you can teach an old dog new tricks :)

#### We can make new friends and invest in relationships
Amazingly, because of the total change in pace I got to get close to some new people in my life, and talk more with certain people on ‘zoom’ that I care about than I did in the past — the location bias of relationships based on who lives around you being equalized, you can make new friendships and deepen some no matter where people are.

#### I need to be more transparent with those close to me about feelings
I am one of those people who is not very open about my feelings - I am much more in the camp of dealing with your problems / taking it and moving on — interestingly, COVID put significant enough stress on me that there were moments that I didn’t feel like I could just swallow hard and move on / and being more open with the people I am closest to was good for me and our relationships.  There will be more of that.

#### I need to be OK not spending every moment I possibly can with my kids
When you leave the house every day, you by definition have time carved away that you are not with your kids / engaging with them… when you are home all the time, you at least in theory can have them around all the time — By default this creates huge guilt, at least for me, when I am not spending every possible waking moment with them that I can — but honestly doing that drives you (or at least me) crazy and the quality-per-minute of the time gets low.  This period taught me I have to be OK taking time for myself / just doing something stupid or reading and not with my kids, and not feel guilty about it.

#### Clear Tasks / Accountability & Measurement is Really Freeing
When I was younger I chaffed - especially in product oriented roles - with the saddle of certain types of measurement… I was always terrified of pareto-optimization around the fact that you always ‘get what you measure’ — I think this is still a big issue, but as I have gotten older I have come to see tight task management and metrics accountability as a huge freeing factor — if you deliver what you were supposed to against the tasks or metrics, I don’t as a manager have to care so much ‘how’ you do it — Now, to be clear, this approach to things has big liability — but in the WFH covid environment it was / is critical and the clear success of projects that fit that signature (and failure of those that don’t) in this period makes me believe more in that pattern for my own work & for what I believe will work in remote environments. 

#### I like longer periods with people
Because everyone was so dramatically ‘slowed’ down by COVID I got to spend longer periods of time with specific people in my life safely bubbled together.  What would have normally been a long-weekend became weeks of living together…. I like this ‘slow travel’ / it builds better relationships.

#### Timezones Impact The Cadence of Your Life
If you are east working with people who are west, you have luxurious mornings with your kids, but your evenings are a mess / dinners, kids bedtime, and what would normally be unwinding time goes away.  If you are west working with people east, you don’t have any mornings BUT you get to be done with your meetings / work day very early …. These facts are obvious, but getting to to experience them for myself over extended periods of time was a pretty interesting experience.  I see benefits of both models, but I think on the margin I like the start-early-end-early variant… especially for families…

#### Watching Kids Growing Up in Hyper Tight Resolution
Whenever I talk to grandparents, etc. who see our kids on portal perhaps weekly, they always remark about how quickly they are growing up — seeming them every few hours with no break for a year-plus, it is interesting because you really don’t see it — they seem the same day-to-day… yet, if you record tons of videos (as I do) it is amazing to look back a few months let alone a year and see the difference.  Our second son learned to walk / stopped crawling in the early days of the first SF lockdown and now jumps and runs around and climbs almost as fast as his brother.  This is mind-blowing… and while not strictly a COVID observation (or a novel one), the reality is heightened this year.  

#### Favorite Media of The Year
Maybe people will make it to the end for this (or scroll for it) — here is what I liked this year:<br><br>
The Origins of Totalitarianism - future writing to come on this fascinating book<br>
Dune - a classic and worth a re-read<br>
What is Health - very interesting book on evolutionary biology<br>
Memos from the Chairman - hilarious and thoughtful view on what capitalism was once<br>
Four Futures - great distillation of where we are going<br>
Defending the Colonies - my brother’s first published historical fiction book!<br>
The Biggest Bluff - great book on poker by a college friend<br>
The Great Influenza - great book on the spanish flu<br>
Public Opinion - Walter lippmann classic<br>
John Stuart Mill and the Meaning of Life - Elijah Millgram<br>

## CONCLUSION

Did anyone make it to the end? :) Probably not… but if you did — overall I still stand behind my 2030 predictions  [My Predictions for the Next Decade — The Information](http://url3476.wlessin.com/ls/click?upn=M-2BELr8rPXGCfE-2F9DJFSYSk8wlLF4EfUzPcrI9KYryM0hwAlUCcyMmUMeqGPISJqq-2B-2B4PrWMdojBvw5MW9LZ-2FOzSNsYQB3JUgkE2-2BTDtW53Tb-2F3Un3xKs2Y89QVNum9E6RdW9_H1cXXxiARgfNUvtRSRytgeW-2F-2BFO3pFOygE1hKG-2FiGM1w-2FG2DBHwtuT-2F6aFz90hvVUD6sFiFmULxHZrXWtUtmK8V8vNPMh2Lvi-2B2V7wG4Y3Q5fkW76hzXQWkBTzcnYJEIxdO-2FEnW-2B1VwmoHFcu7PHzG7ErKNTcDmvVlK7VEinE-2B4fiMkLx1dI6or5YsfVIMosF2t8pSa2U3btx9wraTrhMYR-2Ftro6oME0c8XBVE6EgbqF5WLshKSWnP6LPz04jG14NTPKvZDwRKuRrgHOzjc4-2Ff3rA-2BfZnK2Wm7nzQBUqMSy7vndBIhsplMF2n1gr55AAQIABYcTacvWGjeFrq4VloTjxV7WG7pZn2RqwdD1f3GGPsynkUMUHi7ibZ7YfyTddRLcHt0gVr6Y6cCHKdoA6v-2BJ5UZxTlu-2BeTI3im7WDyZErHQWiJr-2FOp4Ypm1PPWSPY-2Bcc5VqWfwY-2FzOl6vFMm9foVZyeS3bq8goYB-2BQlgtOcGDMgf4JXoFekPOuuZvpKrUvCSHdxbfki0ulcXFPterjIniQnlG2UogIw01EwdZMHXey5VOGbGHQjDL575e4fPYi4AjlsNcchiY1eNiSXL1EZYbB8ARg7DD3FN1E3vybGIf9kFGQfDqeSt0IiOsJel5EWu2DSDHAVKgw-2FFc-2By7YPCjJOOxCTIiDWebLWO21QOGYxEBXI5YOdSUiHU1CbcgbcIKqSsIa-2FQ9OeDPA0UK8P-2BDy-2Bv3S80UrNCZILjXnvfzrxexzosQM28O01RkPzkdAtJ1Nu6P4WcfcEmYnIDM0WyvYSx5N1MDGfP6v8T5verLR2aSHLxboPPC8aSVPzOyxun2zlv25YDuo-2BpnOxAcshDX4K2UE3VN2GTNkRmugEAiBf0SgHdvFCU33AmnFpnF-2F6vFPAj2w91t4fKwNBYS1Bb0ska1VkBzwC3mV3iuUuIQ-3D)  … but specifically the one that I am firmly using to guide my behavior right now is that tech valuations will continue to grow because (a) there is more and more money,  [and nowhere else for it to go](http://url3476.wlessin.com/ls/click?upn=M-2BELr8rPXGCfE-2F9DJFSYSk8wlLF4EfUzPcrI9KYryM0hwAlUCcyMmUMeqGPISJqqTuNU-2BMP07fWONou7dhFe3IhN18w4skabntKrt2qjNyqoUSX7OrDDF7quD6yx4bE-2BItq2_H1cXXxiARgfNUvtRSRytgeW-2F-2BFO3pFOygE1hKG-2FiGM1w-2FG2DBHwtuT-2F6aFz90hvVUD6sFiFmULxHZrXWtUtmK8V8vNPMh2Lvi-2B2V7wG4Y3Q5fkW76hzXQWkBTzcnYJEIxdO-2FEnW-2B1VwmoHFcu7PHzG7ErKNTcDmvVlK7VEinE-2B4fiMkLx1dI6or5YsfVIMosF2t8pSa2U3btx9wraTrhMYR-2Ftro6oME0c8XBVE6EgbqF5WLshKSWnP6LPz04jG14NTPKvZDwRKuRrgHOzjc4-2Ff3rA-2BfZnK2Wm7nzQBUqMSy7vndBIhsplMF2n1gr55AAQIABYcTacvWGjeFrq4VloTjxV7WG7pZn2RqwdD1f3GGPsynkUMUHi7ibZ7YfyTddRLcHt0gVr6Y6cCHKdoA6v-2BJ5UZxTlu-2BeTI3im7WDyZErHQWiJr-2FOp4Ypm1PPWSPY-2Bcc5VqWfwY-2FzOl6vFMm9foVZyeS3bq8goYB-2BQlgtOcGDMgf4JXoFekPOuuZvpKrUvCSHdxbfki0ulcXFPterjIniQnlG2UogIw01EwdZMHXey5VOGbGHQjDL575e4fPYi4AjlsNcchiY1eNiSXL1EZYbB8ARg7DD3FN1E3vybGIf9kFGQfDqeSt0IiOsJel5EWu2DSDHAVKgw-2FFc-2By7YPCjJOOxCTIiDWebLWO21QOGYxEBXI5YOdSUiHU1CbcgbcIKqSsIa-2FQ9OeDPA0UK8P8lKpfqBjzdNdpy8wGDOl97Bl42Ums11TgnzqMW7dzxJKrYe10mAnc2LM5jnjmfnKDQH0cG-2Fd7XcmY65kVEZukzGmYSoZmAmdmXP0Q8TJHu0A470mJg371Os78uDCxuxKrs0dus6h22FbEg59Drd9Son7rMGXcCO3yQbhtINdFBpTUdYiIHRwUwpwVfM-2BGLVOrpi-2B-2FzhdWCJ-2BMcpCBk7HH0-3D)  (b) tech equities have figured out how to securitize ‘hope’ and position themselves as the best way to ‘teleport’ value into the future, which is where value wants to go when the present is both uncertain and pretty shitty.

Wishing everyone a wonderful 2021
